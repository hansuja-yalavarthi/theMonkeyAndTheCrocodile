Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a tree that bore juicy, red apples. He was very happy. One fine day, a
crocodile came to that tree and told him that he had traveled a long distance and was very hungry.
The kind monkey offered the crocodile a few rows of apples. The crocodile enjoyed the apples, and asked the monkey
whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.
The crocodile returned the next day and next one after that. Soon, the two became very good friends.
They discussed their lives, friends, and family like all friends do.
