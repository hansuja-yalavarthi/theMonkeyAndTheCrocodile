Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a tree that bore juicy, red apples. He was very happy. One fine day, a
crocodile came to that tree and told him that he had traveled a long distance and was very hungry.
The kind monkey offered the crocodile a few rows of apples. The crocodile enjoyed the apples, and asked the monkey
whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.
